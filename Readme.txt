This is a simple social media site named Yes B'y. The Site consists of 3 main pages: Login, Sign-up and a feeds page for posts and comments.

The login page will verify if a user has signed up when trying to login in. As of right now, the password verification is disabled (didn't what to have someone use a password they may already have and I was always forgetting the one I used :)). So after signing up, a user will simply have to enter the email address they used.

On the sign-up page, user will have to enter first and last name, email address, password and date of birth. Javascript has been created to check if fields are filled out, passwords match and date of birth is in the correct format.

On the feeds page, it will load for each user identically, as if they are all friends. Each post will be logged with whom submitted it and date of entry, as will all comments. There is a logout out button on the feeds page will redirect the user to the login page.

As a bonus, there is a button on all three pages which can be used to switch between Light and Dark modes. The mode which is currently selected will be saved for all users and can be changed at any time.
